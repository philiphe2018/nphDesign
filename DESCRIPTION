Description: Study Design, Monitoring, and Analysis for Survival Endpoints in Consideration of Non-proportional Hazards (NPH). The package includes the following functions:
(1) Study Design: 
    ***Sample size calculation, 
    ***Expected Average Hazard ratio by calendar time, 
    ***Rejection boundaries in group sequential design using weighted log-rank tests, 
    ***Fisher Information fraction, 
    ***Non-centrality parameter by calendar time
    ***Piecewise exponential data simulation according to non-uniform enrollment distribution function
(2) Survival data analysis
    ***Weighted log-rank test (stratified)
    ***Max-combo test (stratified)
    ***Covariance structure between two weighted log-rank tests at the same time or different calendar time
    ***Rejection boundaries based on previous data
